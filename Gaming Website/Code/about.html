          <p align="left">Peak started off as a regular, plain old summer project of 2019. Today, it is a platform for me, Pitchaya Manopchantaroj, to create thrilling games and entertain the world. I am currently a high school student, interested in coding and gaming, and wanting to create a new chapter for myself. Through this project, I'm hoping to improve in coding and explore how coding can influence others. My mission is to do everything possible to create, in my eyes, the "perfect" game and hopefully inspire you to create one as well. I will be delivering my style and creativity through computer programming languanges, such as, C#, html, css, processing, etc. I'm excited to learn more about you and to potentially make a game based on your feedback. Stay tuned for more exciting games to come in future projects!

          My name is Pitchaya Manopchantaroj. I was born on May 16, 2003 in Thailand. My mother had a job opportunity to work in the United States and brought the whole family with her. I arrived the United States when I was 3 and studied for 5 years before I had to go back to Thailand. I experienced travelling at a young age and have the ability to adapt quickly and also learn English. When I went back to Thailand, it was like starting everything all over again. My parents were very supportive and my father would always teach me math and science. I think during those times is when I found out my passion to learn more about STEM majors. I didn't have any special talents, however, I always had a desire to explore more about the world and to hopefully have an impact on it. Then it happened again, my mom brought me to the United States, thinking it had a better education than in Thailand. Every time I move, I start to see how life is always changing and it never remains static. The education in the United States is far more different than in Thailand. I feel like I have more time to explore my passion and to enjoy hobbies that I like. I love playing basketball a lot and recently started badminton. Ever since I came to the United States, I always try to learn something new during the summer, for example, solving a Rubik's cube in under 30 seconds, practicing card tricks/magic, and building computers. My math teacher during sophomore year told me to try out coding and this is when I really started to have an interest in making games and websites. I've been trying to learn how I can maintain good grades while also pursuing what I love. I think all these experiences make who I am and I really hope to have an exciting future.
