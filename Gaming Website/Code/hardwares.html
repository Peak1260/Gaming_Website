          <h3>RTX 2060 Super<br>By Jarred Walton</h3>
          <p>The GeForce RTX 2060 Super comes nearly one year after Nvidia revealed its first GeForce RTX graphics cards. To take on the existing RTX 2060 and RTX 2070, at roughly similar price points, AMD's RX 5700 GPUs and the Navi architecture could potentially close the gap with Nvidia. And so, Nvidia is launching a preemptive strike with the GeForce RTX 2060 Super and RTX 2070 Super, with an RTX 2080 Super coming later, all in the interest of staying at the top of the heap when it comes to the best graphics cards. The Turing architecture behind the new Super RTX cards is identical to existing RTX cards. In terms of performance, the RTX 2060 Super should be just a tad slower than the reference RTX 2070, but it should also be quite a big jump in performance over the RTX 2060. The pricing reflects this, with the new RTX 2060 Super selling for $399 while the RTX 2060 will continue to be sold for $349. That price makes this one of the best graphics cards in terms of value. The new RTX 2070 Super meanwhile takes over the $499 price point—and that includes the Founders Edition model.</p>

          <h3>AMD Ryzen 3000 series<br>By Jarred Walton</h3>
          <p>The buildup to AMD's launch party for its Ryzen 3000 CPUs has been huge. The Ryzen 3000 processors are the first mainstream CPUs to utilize a 7nm manufacturing process. After flirting with the crown for the first two Ryzen generations, this could be the day when AMD claims an outright victory. Zen 2 adds an improved L2 TAGE branch predictor, has a larger micro-op cache, doubles the maximum size of the L3 cache (to 32MB per CCX), and doubles the AVX floating point performance. There's also a third address generation unit, larger buffers, multiplication latency is reduced to 3 cycles (from 4), and there are wider buses (256-bit instead of 128-bit) to improve bandwidth. PCIe Gen4 support is included, along with changes to the Infinity Fabric that links everything together, and there are improvements in memory compatibility. Wrap all of that up in a 7nm bow, then move the memory controller out of the main CPU chiplet and into a secondary IO chiplet, and stick both into a single package—with the option to have dual CPU chiplets on higher tier models.</p>

          <h3>Corsair's new mid-tower case takes a smart approach to RGB lighting<br>By Paul Lilly</h3>
          <p>Corsair is rolling out a new mid-tower case (iCue 220T RGB Airflow) that is smarter than most. The 220T owes its smartness to an integrated "iCue Lighting Node Core," which is a spiffy way of saying it has an RGB lighting controller. "Plug up to six of the same Corsair RGB fans directly into the included iCue Lighting Node Core to control your RGB lighting without the need for a fan hub, making for brilliant lighting effects right out of the box with Corsair iCue software," Corsair says. This allows for some nifty effects, especially in conjunction with the vented front panel that allows light to seep through. Corsair includes a trio of its SP120 RGB Pro fans to get you started. Each one features eight individually addressable RGB lights, giving you 24 total LEDs to light up your rig. On the storage front, the 220T can swallow a pair of 3.5-inch HDDs and two 2.5-inch SSDs. That's a bit sparse compared to some cases, though should be fine for most setups, especially if using an M.2 drive that plugs directly into the motherboard for the primary storage.</p>

          <h3>Razer Kraken X headset<br>By Benjamin Abbott</h3>
          <p>If you’re looking for a more immersive experience while gaming, you’ve got two choices: you can either take the plunge with the best computer speakers or try out one of the best gaming headsets instead. If the latter’s more your speed, and budget is a concern, the Kraken X is absolutely worth considering. Despite being mostly plastic, this is a very comfortable headset that you’ll be happy sitting with for hours. Both the leatherette head cushion and earcups are cosy without being overly hot. They’re also comfy for those wearing glasses thanks to hidden cut-outs that accommodate the arms. Coming in at a dainty 250g, it’s not exactly going to be weighing you down. This is accompanied by the usual on-board audio and mic control, a non-detachable (yet flexible) cardioid microphone, and 7.1 virtual surround sound via a downloadable app. Although the Kraken X’s surround sound is fine, using the 7.1 add-on elevates it tremendously. It provides greater depth, clarity, and definition that makes going back to standard sound difficult. It also pushes the X’s score up a few notches. For cans that only set you back $50, that’s tremendous value.</p>

          <h3>RAM prices are finally cheap again<br>By Bo Moore</h3>
          <p>Back in 2016, you could get 16GB of DDR4 RAM for around $70, but the increasing demand from mobile phones using DDR4 chips, followed by some setbacks in production drove prices up throughout 2017. The cost of that same 16GB kit peaked around $200 in early 2018. Thankfully there was relief in sight. In late 2018, DRAMeXchange said that falling demand for DRAM at various levels—a combination of sluggish smartphone sales and lower PC and laptop production due to the shortage of Intel CPUs—would lead to lower DRAM prices in 2019 as well. Sure enough, we're finally starting to see memory available at much closer to those pre-shortage prices.</p>
